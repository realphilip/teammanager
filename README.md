An app I made to coordinate teams on open source projects. To be dockerized.

Front-End has been merged into this repository from (github.com/realphilip/teammanagerweb)

Made with Spring Boot/Java (JS/TypeScript + Angular on Front-End)

Requires Database connection (concealed for confidentiality)

To run locally: create application.properties and set local database -> run TeammanagerApplication -> npm install -> ng build -> ng serve (front-end)
